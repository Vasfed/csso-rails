# csso-rails: Stylesheet Optimizer (CSSO) for Rails Asset pipeline

Ruby adapter for [github.com/css/csso](https://github.com/css/csso).

CSSO does structure-optimization for CSS.
CSS is usually reduced more than in half in uncompressed and around 15% in gzipped.

### A Real-World Example
A living rails application CSS – some written in less, some handwritten):

|        | Original     |  sass  | yui 2.4.7  | csso  | % of original
|:-------|:------------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:
|Plain   | 129497       | 107006 | 60758 | 60874 | 47%
|GZipped | 14046        | 12047  | 10558 | 10472 | 74%

Very close to yui compressor, wining in gzipped (you’re using nginx `mod\_gzip_static`, don’t you?)

A more hard example – twitter bootstrap.css, already minified:

|        | Original     | lessc | yui 2.4.7  | csso  | % of original
|:-------|:------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:
|Plain   | 81443        | 71520 | 68755 | 67679 | 83%
|GZipped | 12384        | 11633 | 11652 | 11477 | 92%

Please note than benchmark was taken in summer of 2012, since then things may have changed.

## Usage

### In Rails 3.1+

Add `gem 'csso-rails'` to your gemfile, and that’s it!
(also you may want to add some javascript runtime for ExecJS to pick up, like `gem 'therubyracer'`)

Upon including it becomes the default compressor even if sass is included too.
More explicit way – set in `config/environment/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.assets.css_compressor = :csso
```

### Sprockets

If you use Sprockets without Rails:

```ruby
require 'csso'
Csso.install(sprockets_env)
```

### In Plain Ruby

```ruby
require 'csso'
puts Csso.optimize("a{ color: #FF0000; }") # produces "a{color:red}"
```

In _maniac mode_ (`Csso.optimize(css, true)`, default for pipeline) CSS is processed several times until it stops getting lighter (there're cases when original csso does not do all optimizations for no reason).

### In Command Line

    ruby_csso non_optimized.css > optimized.css
